Welcome to official (or forked) AurorOS GitHub repository. AurorOS is an OS created with passion by Interpuce Team (and other people who wanted to voluntarily get involved in the project). 

You can find here things like AurorOS drivers, Makefile, AurorOS kernel and many more! All is basically open-source, but read the license.
